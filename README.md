## Pixel Draw
**June 2020**

[View Site](https://pixel-draw-brody.netlify.app/)

Pixel Draw is a simple pixel drawing app. It runs on a stack that includes: HTML/CSS, JQuery, and JavaScript. On this site, users can fill in pixels with chosen colors from a pallete to create an image. Users can randomize the color of the pallete or add their own.

## Motivation
I created Pixel Draw to practice getting the hang of implementing a static, single page application using JQuery and JavaScript.
